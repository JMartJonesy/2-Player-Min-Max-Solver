Takeaway:
	1. It runs perfectly.
	2. It always produces best move and position if there is one.
	3. Yes it produces a 1 for a win or -1 for a loss.
	4. Yes it plays against a human correctly.
	5. Yes the answers are correct
	6. No, it does segment fault when you put in a number around 35000
	initial game though.
	7. No leaks

	- To run in solver mode just send a single integer
	  to the command line.
        - Send play and an integer to play a game against the computer.
	  The game will prompt you for a amount of pennies to take
	- ./takeaway [play] num_pennies
        - Using inheritance with the solver in the Game class
          Takeaway inherits from game and uses the Games solver.
	- Moved solver into Game class
	- Added memoization to speed up the solver.

Kayles:
	1. It runs perfectly.
        2. It always produces best move and position if there is one.
        3. Yes it produces a 1 for a win or -1 for a loss.
        4. Yes it plays against a human correctly.
        5. Yes the answers are correct
        6. No, it does segment fault when you put in high ammounts of kayles for
        initial game though.
        7. No leaks

	- To run in solver mode just send integers with spaces for
          number of kayles in a row to the command line.
        - Send play and an integer and a integers with spaces to play against computer.
          The game will prompt you for columns to remove kayles from.
        - ./kayles [play] num_pins num_pins2......
        - Using inheritance with the solver in the Game class
          Kayles inherits from game and uses the Games solver.
        - Moved solver into Game class
        - Added memoization to speed up the solver.


Connect3:

	1. It runs perfectly.
        2. It always produces best move and position if there is one.
        3. Yes it produces a +score for a win and -score for a loss.
        4. Yes it plays against a human correctly.
        5. Yes the answers are correct
        6. No, it does segment fault if you put in a big empty board.
        7. No leaks

	- To run in solver mode just send a - or a file to create 
	  board from to the command line.
	- When using a - user will be prompted for a width and height.
	  Then an initial board all in one line
	  Ex) Enter width: 4
	      Enter height: 3
	      Enter initial board: ........XX..
	      will generate
		....
		....
		XX..
        - Send play and a - or file to play a game against the computer.
          The game will prompt you for a column to place a piece.
        - ./connect3 [play] num_pennies
        - Using inheritance with the solver in the Game class
          Connect3 inherits from game and uses the Games solver.
        - Moved solver into Game class
        - Added memoization to speed up the solver.


Crossout:
	1. It runs perfectly.
        2. It always produces best move and position if there is one.
        3. Yes it produces a 1 for a win or -1 for a loss.
        4. Yes it plays against a human correctly.
        5. Yes the answers are correct
        6. No, it does segment fault when you put in high amounts of Max_num 
	and Max_sum for initial game.
        7. No leaks

	- To run in solver mode just send two integers
          in the command line, first number is max number
	  and second is the max sum of numbers.
        - Send play and two integers to play against computer.
          The game will prompt you for numbers to take.
        - ./crossout [play] max_num max_sum
        - Using inheritance with the solver in the Game class
          Crossout inherits from game and uses the Games solver.
        - Moved solver into Game class
        - Added memoization to speed up the solver.
